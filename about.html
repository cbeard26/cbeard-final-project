                I decided to use this open ended project opportunity to take<br>
                a deeper dive into the production of one type of music that I<br>
                really enjoy: Rock. In the end, it sort of became a case study<br>
                of the band Finish Ticket, whose music I particularly enjoy.<br>
                What I find so enjoyable about their music is the variety of<br> 
                textures that they're able to create using a limited arsenal of<br>
                musical instruments. Their ability to morph sounds in such a way<br> 
                as to encapsulate a feeling or emotion never ceases to amaze me.<br>
                I've recently been reexploring their music, and thought that I'd<br>
                try to reconstruct – or reimagine – some of my favorites. I worked<br>
                entirely in Logic Pro to make this music, mainly becasue I do not<br>
                play any of the instruments that the band uses at any considerable<br>
                level of proficiency, and Logic's variety of built in sounds at<br>
                least gave me a place to start. Taking on a larger project was a<br>
                fun experience in many ways; I learned about time-management methods<br>
                that I could apply in order to streamline my work, and developed<br>
                musical problem solving skills when faced with a sound I couldn't<br>
                easily replicate.
