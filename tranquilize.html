            <h3>The Story</h3><br>
            <p class="story">
                This was the first of the two songs that I worked on, so I was still <br>
                in the process of discovering where I wanted to go with my project.<br>
                I started out by trying to replicate the sound of the original, but<br>
                quickly found that it was difficult to emulate the sounds of live<br>
                instruments using the samplers and MIDI instruments that are available<br>
                 in Logic Pro; I decided that, rather than spend too much time<br>
                fussing over small details, I would try to replicate the feeling of<br>
                 the original while embracing the unique sound that the use of MIDI<br>
                instruments creates. In that respect, I think I was successful, but<br>
                 I also learned a lot about the process of creating this type of music<br>
                during the process. The first instrument that I tried to write in was<br>
                 the guitar, which proved to be very inefficient. After a bit of <br>
                frustration, I restarted from the bottom up, creating the drums and<br>
                 bass first, then the higher instruments, then the vocals. This method<br>
                was much more effective for me: getting the structure in place allowed<br>
                 me to more easily see where I wanted the piece to be by the end.<br>
