            <h3>The Story</h3><br>
            <p class="story">
                This song was completed on a bit of a time-crunch, especially the<br>
                vocals, but it was a much more efficient process because of the<br> 
                knowledge that I gained while making Tranquilize. Starting with the<br>
                percussion was very helpful in this song because the pre-chorus breaks<br>
                from typical timing schemes very subtly. Laying out the timing of<br>
                everything streamlined the production process, allowing me to get a<br> 
                substantial amount of work done in a relatively short time. As with<br> 
                Tranquilize, I worked from the bottom to the top, first creating the<br> 
                drums and bass, then the guitars and pads, then the vocals. I took<br> 
                more creative liberties with this song, especially with the way that<br> 
                the soundscape manifests itself in the chorus; replicating the guitar<br>
                quility of that section proved near impossible for me, so I composed a<br>
                guitar piece that I believe captures the same feeling, even if it doesn't<br>
                make the same use of distortion and pitch-bending found in the original.<br>
                I am happy with the way that this has turned out, especially considering<br> 
                the narrow timeline.
